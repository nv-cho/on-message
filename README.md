# on-message

on-message is a messaging protocol built entirely on Arkiv. Arkiv makes it possible to have fully private on-chain conversations with no intermediaries. 

To start, you only need the recipient’s wallet address. With that, you create a time-limited invitation. While it’s valid, the recipient can open it and join a shared chat room. From that moment, you’re both ready to chat directly on-chain, without relying on any third party and with your privacy fully protected.

Each room has an expiration date. When it expires, all messages in that room are permanently deleted and cannot be restored. This makes every conversation ephemeral, private, and fully controlled by the participants.
